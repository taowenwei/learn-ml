# Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with representation learning.

Deep learning encompasses various types and architectures, each designed to handle specific kinds of data and tasks. Here are some of the main types of deep learning models:

### Summary Table

| Deep Learning Type       | Description                                                   | Use Cases                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) | Simple neural networks with unidirectional flow         | Basic classification and regression tasks      |
| Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) | Use convolutional layers for spatial feature learning  | Image classification, object detection, etc.   |
| Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) | Handle sequential data with cycles for persistence       | Time series prediction, NLP, speech recognition|
| Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) | Overcome vanishing gradient problem in RNNs         | Time series forecasting, language modeling     |
| Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) | Simplified LSTM variant for long-term dependencies         | Similar to LSTMâ€”time series, NLP, speech recognition|
| Autoencoders | Learn efficient codings for dimensionality reduction       | Image denoising, anomaly detection             |
| Variational Autoencoders (VAE) | Probabilistic mapping for generative modeling            | Generative tasks, data imputation              |
| Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) | Competing generator and discriminator networks       | Image generation, data augmentation            |
| Transformers | Self-attention mechanisms for sequential data             | NLP, text generation, image processing         |
| Graph Neural Networks (GNN) | Work directly on graph structures                           | Social network analysis, molecular biology     |
| Capsule Networks | Capture spatial hierarchies and relationships                         | Image classification, object detection         |
| Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) | Unsupervised learning for input space mapping                | Data visualization, clustering                 |

Each type of deep learning model has its own strengths and is suitable for specific tasks. The choice of model depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.
