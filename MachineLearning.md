# Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised machine learning algorithms are techniques used to create models that make predictions or decisions based on labeled training data. These algorithms learn from the input-output pairs in the training data to make predictions or classify new, unseen data. 

Some commonly used are,

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Naive Bayes

## Unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to find patterns and relationships in data without labeled responses. These algorithms identify hidden structures in data, such as clusters or associations, and can be used for exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. 

Some commonly used are,

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

## Deep Learning
Deep learning algorithms are a subset of machine learning algorithms that use multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data. These algorithms are particularly powerful for tasks involving large amounts of data and intricate data structures.

Some commonly used are,

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
3. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
4. Autoencoders
5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
6. Transformer Networks

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The key components in reinforcement learning include the agent, the environment, states, actions, rewards, and policies.

Some commonly used are,

1. Q-Learning
2. SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
3. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
