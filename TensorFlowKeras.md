# Summary

**TensorFlow** is a comprehensive machine learning framework providing both low-level and high-level APIs, capable of handling complex workflows and optimized for performance and scalability.

**Keras** is a high-level API that prioritizes user-friendliness and simplicity, and when used as tf.keras, it combines these features with TensorFlowâ€™s power and scalability.

In practice, you often use tf.keras within TensorFlow to get the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Keras and the power of TensorFlow.
